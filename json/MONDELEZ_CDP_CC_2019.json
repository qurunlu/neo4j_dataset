This explains why reported emissions increased from last year (2018: 8,964,770). For calculating the land use change emissions, Quantis\u2019 Dryad tool was used. Dryad mainly uses FAOSTAT data that are collected from 1990 to the most recent available year for each country crop combination. The tool accounts for all land conversion types eg. Deforestation, secondary forest to pasture land, etc. Used regionalized LCI data, which also covers category \u2018Purchased Goods and Services \u2013 Cradle-to-Grave Emissions,\u2019 in our supply chain. Agricultural raw materials are the main source of CO2 scope 3 emissions, with packaging production contributing an important, but clearly secondary, source of emissions. Our most prominent commodities are: cocoa, wheat, dairy, sugar, palm oil. The supply chain was characterized based on the total mass of purchases of nearly 100 food input material categories and three packaging material categories. For each of these material categories, information on the life cycle GHG emissions was taken from a variety of sources, including the most prominent Ecoinvent database, scientific literature and other available data. In cases where data for the exact commodity or category could not be found, the most suitable proxy available was selected to avoid large gaps. Emissions are determined as the mass purchased multiplied by these factors of GHG emissions per weight. For packaging materials, processing to produce a finished package has been assumed based on emissions information from the Ecoinvent database. In the case of agricultural commodities that require additional processing beyond the level of their representation in the database, insufficient information is available to represent such processes, except in the case that it takes place in one of our facilities.", "explanation": "This year we are one of the first companies reporting emissions that include land use change (LUC), using recently developed LUC reporting methodology.
