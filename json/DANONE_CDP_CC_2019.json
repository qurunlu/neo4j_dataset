Methodology: Danone has chosen a product life cycle analysis (LCA) approach in compliance with GHG Protocol principles to design an internal assessment tool providing the product carbon footprint of its activities worldwide on Scope 3 (Raw ingredients, packaging, co-manufacturing, transportation of raw materials from suppliers gates to Danone plants gates, distribution of finished products, use of sold products, end of life treatment of sold products) \u2013 excluding capital goods, business travel, employees commuting, up and downstream leased assets, franchises and investments (assessed during the tool\u2019s peer review which concluded that each of these stages represent less than 1% of the total emissions). ii. Data: volumes of actual consumption (based on Danone\u2019s ERP) are multiplied by emission factors (EFs) coming from several databases to obtain the corresponding absolute emissions. EFs databases used emanate from professional associations, lifecycle inventory databases and certifications carried out by suppliers on their own specific products. For milk, accounting for 41% of total company emissions in 2018, Danone has used for the first time results of the CoolFarm Tool for most of its reporting scope and from the Cap2Er tool developed together with the French Livestock Institute for France. Default EFs for subsidiaries where the CoolFarm Tool is not implemented yet come from FAO. EFs for dairy ingredients cover milk used in dairy ingredients as well as transformation processes, the latter being based on specific data for key parameters (energy intensity ratios). For the first time, Danone has used supplier\u2019s specific EFs for milk whenever available. Default EFs for milk come from FAO. Other raw materials cover non-dairy ingredients like sugar, starch, fruits preparations. Related EFs are cradle-to-gate and come from lifecycle inventory databases (Ecoinvent). Packaging emissions include production of all packaging types: primary (consumer unit packaging), secondary (selling unit packaging) and tertiary (tray, crate, pallet). EFs come from professional associations (Plastics Europe, FEFCO, FEVE) and lifecycle inventory database (Ecoinvent). For co-making products, produced outside of Danone\u2019s manufacturing sites with the Danone brand, the company is responsible for their distribution to customers.
