It is important to note the following: many of the allocated emissions were not verified by a third party, the level of uncertainty for the allocated emissions ranged from 1-25% and the suppliers used different approaches to estimate these allocations (i.e. allocations based on sales, volume, and units sold). While these emissions represent the scope 3 allocated to us from some of Walmart\u2019s largest suppliers it is not comprehensive. Calculating scope 3 emissions from purchased goods is complex and especially complex for the world\u2019s largest retailer.

Walmart currently inventories data on all of its waste streams from its operations in the U.S. In 2017, Walmart's U.S. based operations generated 5.7 million tons of waste and uneaten food. Due to Walmart's comprehensive and very successful waste diversion programs Walmart was able to divert 80% of these materials. This means that only 1 million tons of waste ended up in landfills in 2017 withthe majority being donated or recycled. We used the U.S. EPA's Waste Reduction Model (WARM) emission factors and proxy materials methodology to estimate emissions for both the waste that ended up in landfills (net emissions of 967079 mtCO2e \u2013 1.9% increase since last year) and the diverted waste that was recycled/repurposed (net storage of 10,490,507 mtCO2e, a 3.4% decrease from previous year). These combined to determine that the total emissions from waste generated in all facilities in the US to be a net storage of 9,650,197 mt CO2e, a 4.1 percent decrease from 2016. The WARM emission factors are based on material specific life-cycle studies and assume national average landfill operational characteristics (i.e. no gas capture, gas flaring, or waste to energy). The emission factors also account for the emissions from transportation vehicles and equipment to move the waste to landfills or recycling processing centers.
