Methodology: Danone has chosen a product life cycle analysis (LCA) approach in compliance with GHG Protocol principles to design an internal assessment tool providing the product carbon footprint of its activities worldwide on Scope 3 (Raw ingredients, packaging, co-manufacturing, transportation of raw materials from suppliers gates to Danone plants gates, distribution of finished products, use of sold products, end of life treatment of sold products) \u2013 excluding capital goods, business travel, employees commuting, up and downstream leased assets, franchises and investments (assessed during the tool\u2019s peer review which concluded that each of these stages represent less than 1% of the total emissions). ii. Data: volumes of actual consumptions (based on Danone\u2019s ERP) are multiplied by emission factors coming from several databases toobtain the corresponding absolute emissions. Databases used emanate from professional associations (Plastics Europe, FEFCO, FEVE), lifecycle inventory databases (Ecoinvent, Carbon Trust) and certifications carried out by our suppliers on their own specific products. For emissions coming from milk, accounting for 41% if emissions at group level, Danone has developed together with the French Livestock Institute an in- house tool (Milk tool) calculating emissions by liter of milk based on a large number of parameters (feeding composition, yield per cow, manure management type, crops cultivation, etc.). Emission factors for dairy ingredients cover transformation processes and are based on specific data for key parameters (energy intensity ratios) of countries where processes take place. Other raw materials cover non-dairy ingredients like sugar, starch, fruits preparations and related emissions are cradle-to-gate. For fruit preparations, emissions cover fruit cultivation, first transformation process, storage of the prepared fruit, second transformation process, as well as transportation between these steps. For packaging, emissions include production of all packaging types, i.e. primary (consumer unit packaging), secondary (selling unit packaging) and tertiary (tray, crate, pallet). For co-making products, produced outside of Danone\u2019s manufacturing sites with the Danone brand, the company is responsible for their distribution to customers. Related emissions are calculated based on primary data from co-manufacturers.", "explanation": "n.a.", "division_by_company": ""}, {"company_name": "Danone", "report_file": "DANONE_CDP_CC_2018", "type": "GHG_emission", "scope": "Scope 3", "report_pubilic_year": "2018", "name": "Capital goods", "unit": "metric_tonnes_co2e", "quantity": "0", "reporting_data_start_date": "01/01/2017", "reporting_data_end_date": "31/12/2017", "Emissions calculation methodology": "n.a.", "explanation": "Danone has carried out an assessment of these emissions in 2008.
