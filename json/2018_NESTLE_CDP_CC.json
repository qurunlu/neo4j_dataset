Data used 2016 data, as 2017 data is not yet available. For transport with own fleet, the reported fuel consumption is converted into CO2 emission using DEFRA emission factors. For outsourced transportation, we use as primary data information per transportation lane (distance, number of shipments, transport vehicle, tonnage transported) collected per market/business. For outsourced road transport, the fuel consumption is estimated using average fuel consumption per vehicle type for the reported transport distance, which is then converted into CO2 emission using DEFRA factors. For non road transport (always outsourced), the transportation volume is calculated in tonne.kms, which are then converted to CO2 emission using standard DEFRA factors. For warehousing, basic data is number of pallet spaces in markets or business per warehouse type (ambient, refrigerated, chilled, frozen). 2. Methodology Per reporting market, the CO2 emissions for transportation are summed up and shown with the following KPIs: absolute CO2 emissions, CO2 effectivness (kg CO2e per tonne sold), CO2 efficiency (g CO2e per tonne.km), average distribution distance, breakdown to transport modes based on tonne.km transported (road, combined, rail, sea, air). The data of the reporting markets is aggregated separately for water and non water businesses. The global CO2e emissions for transportation are extrapolated to the complete sold volume, using separately the average CO2 effectivness for non water business and for water business. For warehousing, the total energy consumption (assumption \u201celectricity only\u201d) is estimated based on the number of pallet spaces multiplied with an average energy consumption per pallet per year, different per warehouse type (based on a separate reporting, which is done for the globally 100 biggest warehouses used by Nestl\u00e9). The electricity consumption is converted into indirect CO2 emission using country specific indirect CO2e emission factors. Extrapolation to global level for warehousing by applying the average CO2 emission per tonne of product to the remaining volume of products sold. 3.
